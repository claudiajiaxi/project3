        <p>The world is so BIG!I'd like to go.</p>
        <p>Hiking is one thing that does not require expertise to do unless your plans are to reach the top of Mount Everest.</p>
        <p>Hiking is fun because of the joy you get afterward by defeating the challenges like walking for miles while you are still tired. Besides that, the connection between you and nature becomes strong which makes hiking more fun and enjoyable. </p>
